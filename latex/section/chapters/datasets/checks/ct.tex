\subsubsection{B-hadrons $ct$}
\label{subsubsec:mc_ct}

We first check that the B meson are generated with the correct lifetime as reported in the Particle Data Book (PDG), by fitting the proper decay time for each B hadron, which can be easily computed from the generation information.
\draft{which mi pare corretto, si rifereisce al proper decay time}

The algorithm iterated on all the B-hadrons in each event of the datasets and collected each decay time in histograms separed by particle type (including charge).
The histograms were then fitted with an exponential distribution, and the parameters from the fit were compared to the tabulated mean life of the particle.

%Initially the fits showed that each meson had a biased decay distribution whenever its decay was taken as main vertex of the event (\autoref{gr:bu_bct_521_biased}), with a distribution that was not purely exponential.
%This is explained by the relative rarity of the B-decays: the main reconstructed decay represents a large part of the available statistics for its flavour, especially in more rare particles such as the \PsB, where this behaviour was accentuated.
%In MC samples the main decay is usually the one that is requested in production and is thus biased by the additional requests specific of each sample.
%To avoid biases induced by the requirement in the event generation, we should exclude from this analysis the main meson of the MC event.
%Unfortunately this information is not available in the datasets.
%We instead ignore the mesons that we use as fully reconstructed meson of the event (the one we use for our main analysis). 
%Since for MC we always reconstruct the same rare decay that is required during generation, the main reconstructed vertex is usually also the main generated one.
%By excluding the reconstructed meson we are thus able to completely remove the bias.
%\draft{non e' il trigger, almeno non credo, e' la generazione. E non abbiamo escluso in non trigger matched, abbiamo escluso quelli che non consideriamo il principale completamente ricostruito}
We exclude from each event the meson that would trigger our reconstruction, as its decay time would be biased.

%TODO add gr:bu_bct_521_biased
The fit results are nicely compatible with the world average for each B hadron considered, as shown in \autoref{gr:ct} and \autoref{tab:ct}, for both particles and antiparticles.
