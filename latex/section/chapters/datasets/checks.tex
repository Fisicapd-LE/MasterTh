\subsection{Preliminary checks on Monte Carlo sample}
\label{subsec:preliminary}

Before starting with the analysis it is necessary to check if the data from the Monte Carlo samples is a faithful representation for the data in the Charmonium dataset.
It's particularly important in our case as we completely rely on the Monte Carlo models for the fit.
