\subsection{Fake MVA fit}
\label{subsec:fake_mva_fit}

The first step for the analysis was to fit the models of the fake rejection MVA output  over the data.
The fit was performed separately in the already mentioned \pt and \psrap windows, to accomodate the difference in the distributions of the MVA.
Additionally, the data was fitted indipendently for signal ($abs\left(\mathrm{d}z\right) < \SI{0.4}{\cm}$) and pileup ($abs\left(\mathrm{d}z\right) > \SI{0.4}{\cm}$) \Pgm.

The assumption that we made, that the MVA keeps the same distribution for signal and pileup \Pgm was verified to hold, since no particular problems were found when fitting the two samples.
The interpolation converged properly in all of the windows.
